You canâ€™t declare a static variable without defining it as well 
(this is because the storage class modifiers static and extern are mutuallyexclusive). 
A static variable can be defined in a header file, 
but this would cause each source file that included the header file to have its own private copy of the variable, 
which is probably not what was intended.
