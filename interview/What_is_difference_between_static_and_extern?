The static storage class is used to declare an identifier that is a local variable 
either to a function or a file and that exists and retains its value after control 
passes from where it was declared. 
This storage class has a duration that is permanent. 
A variable declared of this class retains its value from one call of the function to the next. 
The scope is local. 
A variable is known only by the function it is declared within or if declared globally in a file, 
it is known or seen only by the functions within that file. 
This storage class guarantees that declaration of the variable also initializes the variable to zero or all bits off.


The extern storage class is used to declare a global variable that will be known to the functions in a file 
and capable of being known to all functions in a program. 
This storage class has a duration that is permanent. 
Any variable of this class retains its value until changed by another assignment. 
The scope is global. 
A variable can be known or seen by all functions within a program.
