volatile has nothing to deal with storage class.
volatile just tells the compiler or force the compiler to "not to do the optimization" for that variable. 
so compiler would not optimize the code for that variable and reading the value from the specified location, 
not through interal register which holds the previous value.
So, by declaring variable as volatile, it gives garrantee that you will get the latest value, 
which may be alterred by an external event.
your code may be work fine if haven't declare that variable as volatile, 
but there may be chance of not getting correct value sometimes, so to avoid that we should declare variable as volatile.
volatile is generally used when dealing with external events, like interrupts of hardware related pins.
