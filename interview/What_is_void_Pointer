Void pointer or generic pointer is a special type of pointer that can be pointed at objects of any data type. 
A void pointer is declared like a normal pointer, using the void keyword as the pointerâ€™s type.

Pointers defined using specific data type cannot hold the address of the some other type of variable 
i.e. it is incorrect in C to assign the address of an integer variable to a pointer of type float.

Example:

float *f; //pointer of type float
int i;  //integer variable
f = &i; //compilation error

The above problem can be solved by general purpose pointer called void pointer.

Void pointer can be declared as follows:

void *v // defines a pointer of type void

The pointer defined in this manner do not have any type associated with them and can hold the address of any type of variable.

Example:

void *v;
int *i;
int ivar;
char chvar;
float fvar;
v = &ivar; // valid
v = &chvar; //valid
v = &fvar; // valid
i = &ivar; //valid
i = &chvar; //invalid
i = &fvar; //invalid
