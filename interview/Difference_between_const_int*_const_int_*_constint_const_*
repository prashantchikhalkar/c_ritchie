Difference between 
const int*
const int * const
int const *

You may mess up with these three definitions, a simple rule of thumb here is: read it backwards...

    int* : pointer to int
    
    int const*: pointer to a const int, which means you cannot change *ptr
    
    int * const: const pointer to a int, which means you cannot point to other int
    
    int const* const: const pointer to const int

 the first const can be on either side.

    const int*
    const int* const
