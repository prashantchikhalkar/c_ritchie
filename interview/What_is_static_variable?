There are 3 main uses for the static.

1. If you declare it within a function: 
  It retains the value between function calls.

2. If it is declared for a function name: 
  By default function is extern, so it will be visible from other files 
  If the function declaration is as static, it is invisible for the outer files.

3. Static for global variables: 
  By default we can use the global variables from outside files
  If it is static global, that variable is limited to with in the file.
