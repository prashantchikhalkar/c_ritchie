The const qualifier explicitly declares a data object as something that cannot be changed. 
Its value is set at initialization. 
You cannot use const data objects in expressions requiring a modifiable lvalue. 
For example, a const data object cannot appear on the lefthand side of an assignment statement
  int const volatile var
