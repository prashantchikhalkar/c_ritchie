In C programming, one of the frequently arising problem is to handle similar types of data. 

For example: If the user want to store marks of 100 students. 
This can be done by creating 100 variable individually but, this process is rather tedious and impracticable. 
These type of problem can be handled in C programming using arrays.

An array is a sequence of data item of homogeneous value(same type).
