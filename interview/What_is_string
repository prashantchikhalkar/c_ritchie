The string in C programming language is actually a one-dimensional array of characters 
which is terminated by a null character '\0'. 
Thus a null-terminated string contains the characters that comprise the string followed by a null.

What is difference between these two,

char ptr[] = "string";
char *ptr = "string";

The two declarations are not the same.

First one is the array of character i.e. string and second one is the string literals.

char ptr[] = "string"; declares a char array of size 7 and initializes it with the characters s ,t,r,i,n,g and \0. 
You are allowed to modify the contents of this array.

char *ptr = "string"; declares ptr as a char pointer and initializes it with address of string literal "string" which is read-only.
Modifying a string literal is an undefined behavior. What you saw(seg fault) is one manifestation of the undefined behavior.
